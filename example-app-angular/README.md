# ExampleAppAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.23.
This app wants to showcase the use of cucumber with Angular. Without using E2E and thus reducing flakyness.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Run Tests

Run `npm run test` to execute cucumber-tests

## Sidenotes

Test were build using Jest using the awesome [Jest-schematic](https://github.com/briebug/jest-schematic).
Here I don't use [cucumber.js](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js) directly but [jest-cucumber](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-cucumber).
